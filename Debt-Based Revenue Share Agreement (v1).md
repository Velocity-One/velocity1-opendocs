**PROVISIONS**

**OBJECT:**

The Investor grants the Developer support which is valued in the following form:

1. Training Resources (Valued $1000):

1. Value-Added Services (Valued $1000~$4000 subject to further agreements):

The Developer shall have the opportunity to apply for additional funding or support from the Investor under the terms outlined in this agreement. The Investor retains the discretion to approve or deny any such application.

**COMPENSATION:**

In consideration of the support provided by the Investor, the Developer agrees to share a percentage of all revenue generated by the Project with the Investor. The revenue share percentages are as follows:

- Initial 3 Months (Honeymoon Period): 5%
- Months 4 to 9: 20%
- Months 10 onwards: 10%

**MULTIPLE/CAP:**

The revenue share to the Investor is subject to a multiple/cap of 5 times. This means that the total amount of revenue shared by the Developer to the Investor will not exceed 5 times the initial support/investment.

Upon reaching the multiple/cap of 5 times, the revenue-sharing agreement between the Developer and the Investor is considered completed. At this point, the Developer no longer holds any obligation to share further revenue with the Investor, and the Investor shall have no additional claims or entitlements under this agreement.

In the event of the sale of the Project within 18 months from the commencement of this agreement, the revenue share multiple/cap will be reduced to 3 times.

If the Project is sold before the revenue share model is fully completed, the remaining revenue share obligation converts to a debt, and the Developer shall make a one-time cash payment to the Investor. The final repayment date for the remaining revenue share (balloon payment) will be within 30 days of the date sold. On this final repayment date, the Developer must pay the Investor the remaining amount to fulfill the adjusted multiple/cap.

The Developer shall actively participate in the incubation camp provided by the Investor. The terms of participation are as follows:

- Upon joining the incubator, the Developer is required to pay a deposit of $299. This deposit is intended to ensure the Developer's commitment and efforts during the incubation period.
