The Founder shall have the opportunity to apply for additional funding or support from the Incubator under the terms outlined in this agreement. The Incubator retains the discretion to approve or deny any such application.

**COMPENSATION:**

In consideration of the support provided by the Incubator, the Founder agrees to share a percentage of all revenue generated by the Project with the Incubator. The revenue share percentages are as follows:

- 20% of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) up to and including $10,000
- 10% of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) exceeding $10,000

For example, if the MRR is $15,000, the revenue share would be calculated as:
(20% x $10,000) + (10% x $5,000) = $2,000 + $500 = $2,500

**MULTIPLE/CAP:**

The revenue share to the Incubator is subject to a multiple/cap of **5 times**. This means that the total amount of revenue shared by the Founder to the Incubator will not exceed 5 times the initial support/investment.

Upon reaching the multiple/cap of 5 times, the revenue-sharing agreement between the Founder and the Incubator is considered completed. At this point, the Founder no longer holds any obligation to share further revenue with the Incubator, and the Incubator shall have no additional claims or entitlements under this agreement.

In the event of the sale of the Project within 18 months from the commencement of this agreement, the revenue share multiple/cap will be reduced to 3 times.

If the Project is sold before the revenue share model is fully completed, the remaining revenue share obligation converts to a debt, and the Founder shall make a one-time cash payment to the Incubator. The final repayment date for the remaining revenue share (balloon payment) will be within 30 days of the date sold. On this final repayment date, the Founder must pay the Incubator the remaining amount to fulfill the adjusted multiple/cap.

**INCUBATION:**

The Founder shall actively participate in the incubation camp provided by the Incubator. The terms of participation are as follows:

- Upon joining the incubator, the Founder is required to pay a deposit of **$299**. This deposit is intended to ensure the Founder's commitment and efforts during the incubation period (3 months).
- The deposit is refundable if the Founder achieves the predefined goals by the end of the incubation period. The specific goals will be mutually determined by the Founder and the Incubator.
